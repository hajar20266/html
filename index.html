 <br> <h1>there are programmable machines that use a set of specific instruction , rather than general programming languages..
 
 <br>since the early 1800. programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as jacquard looms , music
 
 <br> boxes and player pianos.{1} the programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior
 <br> in response to different inputs or conditions

 <br> thousands of different programming languages have been created ' and more are  being created every year.many 
 
 <br> programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e.' as a sequence of operations to perform) 
 
 <br> while other languages use the declarative from (i.e.the desired result is specified , not how to achieve it..
 
   <br> the description of a programming languages is usually split into the two components of syntax ( form and semantics(meaning). some 
   
  <br> languages are defined by a specification document (for example the c programming language is specified by an iso
  
  <br> standerd) while other languages (such as perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.
  
  <br> some languages have both with the basic language defined by a standerd and extensions taken from the
  <br> dominant implementation being common..
